# Shadowverse_Collection
A gui-based collection manager for the card game Shadowverse. 
Can sort it using the column tabs for every column except number owned.
Can filter out rows using the textbox below the table.
The Calculate Vial Value button basically prints out the expected value of opening a certain pack counted by one of the game
currencys, vials. It's explained more in the comments of the program.
Fixed as many intellij warnings as I could without risking messing stuff up.
Has some javadoc documentation.

No problems/bugs I've seen so far.

Nothing special needed to run the project other than the basic SQL stuff.
Change my username/pass in SVCollectionDB, create shadowverse_collection DB in mysql, grant all on it etc
